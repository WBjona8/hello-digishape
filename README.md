# hello-digishape

Hello Digishape is a small example project showing the standard layout suggested for committing projects to the digishape open source platform.

## Description

For a standard package layout, pyscaffold is being used. It is suggested to use the latests version of pyscaffold.

There are no strict package requirements for committing to the digishape OSP, so the layout shown in this example package should be considered as a suggestion. It is strongly encouraged to either build CLI capabilities or an API with your code, this way the reusability is greatly increased.

The main requirement for committing to the OSP is documenting the interfaces to your code. A clear explanation of the expected input and output of your code and a couple of examples have to be provided in order to show other users what can be expected from the package. Full documentation of the code is strongly encouraged, but not required.

The use of larger well-maintained python packages and frameworks is encouraged (fastapi, pydantic, pandas, streamlit).
