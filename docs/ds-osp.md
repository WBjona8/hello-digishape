# Digishape open source platform - Vision

## Introduction
The digishape open source platform is a platform where code can easily be shared between contractors, knowledge institues and consultancies. The goal of the Digishape open source platform is to encourage companies to share code with the community and work in cooperation on the development of new tools.

To achieve this goal, the platform has to fulfill a number of requirements:
* reachable
* guidelines for the development of code that do not constrain the developers, but do increase the interoperability of code
* well documented and indexed

For the sharing of data connections are being made with existing initiatives sharing the FAIR data principles.


## Added value of the Digishape open source platform
In the Netherlands there is a strong focus on datadriven solutions and digitization of existing products and services. Regularly different companies are separately building solutions for similar problems. From a national viewpoint this is a waste of money and talent. The Digishape OSP encourages parties to cooperate and combine their shared knowledge to produce high quality digital products and services. This creates an environment in which innovation is supported and generates added value for the dutch governmental services and increases our competitive edge in the water sector internationally.

## Digital challenges
By sharing code on the Digishape OSP and developing new tools in cooperation, there will be an increase in trust in the developed products / services, but also between the involved companies. Since the development and hosting of the code will be on a neutral platform with shared development guidelines and open-source licensing, everyone can cooperate and add their knowledge / experience to the product. This will increase the overal product quality and will ensure that everyone can access and use the code.
The guidelines for code development focus mainly on the interfaces with other software, assuring that the developed tools have a high interoperability and that the in- and output of the tools are well defined. This way the tools can be used in larger systems where multiple smaller tools are coupled into larger workflows. By using this modular strategy, the re-use of tools is encouraged and a wider group of companies can benefit from the developed tools.
